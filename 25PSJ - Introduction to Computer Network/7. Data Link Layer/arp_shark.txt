Answers to Questions

Purpose of ARP Request: 
To discover the MAC address associated with a specific IP address on the local network segment.

Purpose of ARP Reply:  
To provide the requested MAC address to the device that initiated the ARP request.

Difference in Destination MAC:  
ARP Requests use broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) to reach all devices on the network.  
ARP Replies use unicast (the requester's MAC address) since the responder knows exactly who needs the information.

No Reply for Packet 5:  
The most likely reasons are that 10.0.0.200 is on a different network, the device is offline, or the IP isn't assigned.
