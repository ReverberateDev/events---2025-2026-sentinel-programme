Netcat command I used:
nc -v example.com 80

First request (worked):
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: example.com

First response:

Code: 200 OK

Type: text/html

Cached for 715 seconds

Second request (failed):
GET /notexisting HTTP/1.0
Host: example.com

Second response:

Code: 404 Not Found

Type: text/html

Not cached at all

Why different:

200 means page exists

404 means page doesn't exist

Working page gets cached

Broken page doesn't get cached

Both show same example page because it's example.com
