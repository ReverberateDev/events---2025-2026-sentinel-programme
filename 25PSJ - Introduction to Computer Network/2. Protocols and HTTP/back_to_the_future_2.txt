Purpose: Tells the server what file formats/MIME types the client (browser) can handle. The server uses this to send an appropriate response format (e.g., HTML, XML, or a fallback).

Why Browsers Allow Easy Changes:

Debugging/Development:

Lets developers test edits live without altering the actual server files.

Essential for prototyping or fixing layout issues.

Educational Use:

Users can learn HTML/CSS by experimenting visually.

Temporary Customization:

Users can modify pages for readability (e.g., increasing font size) or accessibility.

Usefulness:

Immediate visual feedback speeds up development.

No server-side changes needed for testing.

Helps understand how websites are structured.
