5. Explanation:
The desktop version identifies a Firefox browser running on a Linux computer, which tells websites to send the full desktop version of their pages. The mobile version clearly identifies an iPhone running iOS 14.6 with Safari browser, which makes websites send mobile-optimized content with touch-friendly interfaces. The "Mobile" tag and different WebKit version help servers further optimize the experience for smaller screens and touch input.
